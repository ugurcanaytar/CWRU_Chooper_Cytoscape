**Update**: In addition to Q-Node and its Top-K result, direct neighbours of Q-Node can be visualized. <br />
Despite the old version, Q-Node will be coloured with Red and Diamond shape. <br />
Top-K nodes will be coloured with Blue and Direct-Neighbours will be coloured with Green both in a Triangular shape. <br />
